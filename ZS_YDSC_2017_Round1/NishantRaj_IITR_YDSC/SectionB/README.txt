The current model that I have prepared is on Jupyter notebook and has some Python based general dependencies that may need to be installed.
The current Python version of the Jupyter notebook being used is Python 3.5.
Keep the train.csv and test.csv files in the same directory in which dataset is being run.
Final Prediction Folder contains file that needs to be evaluated: NishantRaj_IITR_ZS_YDSC
Requirements : train.csv and test.csv file from the competition dataset
Just run all the cells in sequential manner to generate .csv file names "NishantRaj.csv"
NDCG function written and present in the code is just for demonstration purpose. A seperate holdout and test set will need to be prepared 
in order to see cross-validation scoring.
"Other Files" named folder contains a part of my work that are provided are just for the purpose of demonstration of work.
